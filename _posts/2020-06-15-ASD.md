## Step 1: 강화학습1

Remove `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, `assets` folders and files within. You won't need these anymore as they're bundled in the theme.

If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as [overrides](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) to the versions bundled with the theme.

```ruby
gem "jekyll", :git => "https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git"
```
